# Simplify Compliance and Governance with Cloud Custodian

In the fast-paced world of DevOps, speed, feedback, and continuous improvement are the cornerstones of success. However, navigating through the maze of compliance and policies in an enterprise can be akin to deciphering legal jargon - well-defined but often incomprehensible to the average person until a lawyer steps in. Developers find themselves spending considerable time in compliance meetings, grappling with heaps of documents.

Imagine a world where compliance and policies are not just well-documented but also executable. Enter Cloud Custodian, an open-source tool that promises to revolutionize the way enterprises approach compliance automation.

## The Compliance Conundrum

In any enterprise, compliance and governance are indispensable, resembling the intricate web of laws governing our society. However, the challenge lies in making these compliance requirements not just understandable but also actionable for developers. Automation is the key, but the choice of tools matters.

While there are various options like Python scripts and Open Policy Agent (OPA), the real game-changer is the accessibility and comprehensibility of the automation source code. Cloud Custodian provides a solution that is not only effective but also transparent.

## Why Cloud Custodian?

### 1. Simplified Automation

Cloud Custodian allows developers to automate compliance checks and policies with ease. Developers can receive notifications about compliance status without delving into voluminous documents. If an issue arises, they are guided on how to rectify it.

### 2. Accessibility

Unlike complex home-grown solutions, Cloud Custodian offers a more straightforward approach. With around 200 lines of code and 150 lines of automated test code, we can implement functionalities like garbage collection for RDS. In contrast, a similar functionality in a home-grown solution would demand around 5000 lines of code and 500 lines of test code. The difference is staggering.

### 3. Centralized Governance

Cloud Custodian consolidates governance rules in a single, centralized repository. This eliminates the need to scatter rules across numerous repositories and pipelines, streamlining the entire governance process.

## Why Choose a Ready-Made Solution?

Governance requirements in the cloud are universal, and while each company may have unique needs, opting for a mature solution should be the first line of defense. Cloud Custodian, with its open-source nature, strikes a balance between simplicity and effectiveness, offering a compelling alternative to extensive, in-house solutions.

In the ever-evolving landscape of DevOps, where time is of the essence, Cloud Custodian stands out as a powerful tool to simplify compliance and governance. It empowers developers, accelerates workflows, and ensures that the crucial balance between agility and control is maintained. Choose Cloud Custodian for a compliance strategy that not only meets the enterprise standards but transforms them for the better.
